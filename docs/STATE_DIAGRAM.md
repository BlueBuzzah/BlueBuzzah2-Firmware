## 1. TherapyState State Machine

The `TherapyState` enum defines all possible states of the therapy system. Both PRIMARY and SECONDARY devices maintain their own state, synchronized via SYNC messages.

```

- **Prefix**: `SYNC:` identifies synchronization messages
- **Command**: Action to perform
- **Parameters**: Pipe-delimited key-value pairs

| Notification | Characteristic | Payload | Description |
|--------------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `SESSION_STARTED` | Status | `{session_id, ts}` | Session began |
