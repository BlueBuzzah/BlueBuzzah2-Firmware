## Overview

BlueBuzzah v2 uses **manual hardware integration tests** to validate firmware functionality on actual Feather nRF52840 devices. The testing approach emphasizes:

- **Real hardware validation** - Tests run on actual Arduino/PlatformIO devices
- **BLE protocol verification** - Validates command/response behavior
- **Memory monitoring** - Ensures firmware memory stability
- **Synchronization accuracy** - Measures multi-device timing
- **Manual execution** - Requires human setup and intervention

### What This Testing Does

✓ Validates BLE command protocol (8 out of 18 commands)
✓ Verifies haptic motor calibration workflow
✓ Tests therapy session management commands
✓ Monitors memory usage over extended periods
✓ Measures synchronization latency between devices

### What This Testing Does NOT Do

✗ Unit testing of individual components
✗ Automated CI/CD integration
✗ Mock-based testing without hardware
✗ Code coverage reporting
✗ Automated regression testing

## BLE Protocol Testing

### Command Format

All tests use the BLE Protocol v2.0 format:

**Request:**
```
COMMAND_NAME:ARG1:ARG2\x04
```

**Response:**
```
KEY:VALUE\x04
```

The `\x04` (EOT) terminator is **mandatory** for all messages.

### Response Validation

Tests validate:
1. **Presence of EOT** - Response must contain `\x04`
2. **Response timing** - Must arrive within timeout (2-5 seconds)
3. **Format** - Expects `KEY:VALUE` structure
4. **Success keywords** - Looks for "OK", "STARTED", "COMPLETE", "STOPPED"
5. **Error detection** - Checks for "ERROR", "FAIL", "INVALID"

### Protocol Timing

Per BLE_PROTOCOL.md specification:

- **Minimum inter-command delay:** 100ms
- **Command timeout:** 2-5 seconds (depends on command complexity)
- **Response time:** <1 second for most commands
- **Session commands:** Up to 5 seconds (involve state changes)

---

## Memory Testing

### Arduino/nRF52840 Memory Budget

- **Total RAM:** 256 KB
- **Available after BLE stack:** ~200 KB
- **Typical firmware usage:** ~50-80 KB
- **Safe headroom:** >100 KB free

### Memory Monitoring

The memory stress test checks for:

1. **Baseline stability** - Memory should stabilize after initialization
2. **Leak detection** - No continuous downward trend
3. **Stack overflow** - Monitor stack usage with `dbgMemInfo()`
4. **Heap fragmentation** - Check for allocation failures

### Memory Failure Indicators

Warning signs:
- Continuous downward trend over hours
- Hard faults or crashes during extended operation
- Allocation failures in serial output
- Watchdog resets

### Memory Optimization

Best practices for Arduino C++ firmware:

- Use `static` allocation where possible
- Pre-allocate buffers at startup
- Avoid `String` concatenation in loops (use `snprintf`)
- Use `F()` macro for string literals to keep them in flash
- Prefer stack allocation for small temporary buffers

---

## Synchronization Testing

### Multi-Device Coordination

BlueBuzzah uses command-driven synchronization (SYNCHRONIZATION_PROTOCOL.md):

**Synchronization Flow:**
```
PRIMARY → BUZZ:seq:timestamp:finger|amplitude → SECONDARY
PRIMARY ← BUZZED:seq ← SECONDARY
```

### Latency Budget

Per protocol specification:

| Component | Budget | Typical |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| BLE transmission | 5-10 ms | 7.5 ms |
| Command processing | 1-3 ms | 2 ms |
| Motor activation | 2-5 ms | 3 ms |
| Response generation | 0.5-1 ms | 0.8 ms |
| **Total round-trip** | **10-20 ms** | **13.3 ms** |

### Jitter Analysis

The sync test measures jitter (latency variation):

- **Good:** <2ms standard deviation
- **Acceptable:** 2-5ms standard deviation
- **Poor:** >5ms standard deviation (investigate BLE interference)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** Cannot connect to device

**Solutions:**
1. Verify device is powered on and advertising
2. Check LED indicates BLE active (should pulse)
3. Restart device (press RESET button)
4. Ensure device not already connected to another host
5. Reduce distance to <2 meters
6. Check host Bluetooth is enabled

**Problem:** Connection drops mid-test

**Solutions:**
1. Check battery level (low battery degrades BLE)
2. Eliminate 2.4GHz interference sources (WiFi, microwaves)
3. Reduce distance between devices
4. Verify firmware not crashing (check serial console)

### Test Failures

**Problem:** Commands timeout (no response)

**Root Causes:**
- Device crashed - check serial console for errors
- BLE connection lost - verify connection still active
- Device in wrong state - ensure preconditions met
- Command queue full - add delay between commands

**Problem:** ERROR responses

**Root Causes:**
- Invalid command syntax - verify format matches protocol spec
- Device not in correct state - check state requirements
- SessionManager disabled - some commands require it enabled
- Hardware fault - check serial console for hardware errors

**Problem:** Inconsistent motor activation

**Root Causes:**
- DRV2605 initialization failed - check I2C connections
- Multiplexer channel selection issue - verify multiplexer wiring
- Motor disconnected - check physical connections
- Amplitude too low - increase intensity parameter

### Memory Test Issues

**Problem:** Memory declining during test

**Action Plan:**
1. Stop test immediately
2. Review recent firmware changes
3. Use `dbgMemInfo()` for heap/stack analysis
4. Check for loop allocations
5. Review `String` usage and avoid concatenation in loops
6. Use `F()` macro for flash-based string literals

**Problem:** MemoryError during test

**Immediate Action:**
1. Note timestamp and operation when error occurred
2. Check device serial console for stack trace
3. Review code path that caused error
4. Identify allocation that exceeded available memory
5. Apply memory optimization techniques

## Test Results Interpretation

### PASS Criteria

A test is considered **PASSED** if:
- All commands return valid responses
- Responses arrive within timeout period
- Response format matches protocol specification
- No ERROR or FAIL keywords in responses
- Hardware behaves as expected (for calibration tests)

### FAIL Criteria

A test is considered **FAILED** if:
- Command times out with no response
- Response contains ERROR or FAIL keyword
- Response format is invalid (missing EOT, wrong structure)
- Hardware does not behave as expected

### UNKNOWN Results

Some tests may return **UNKNOWN** if:
- Response format is unexpected but not clearly an error
- Response timing is borderline
- Human verification required (for calibration tests)

### Success Rates

**Expected success rates on working hardware:**

- Calibration tests: 95-100%
- Session tests: 90-100% (depends on SessionManager config)
- Memory tests: 100% (should never fail on stable firmware)
- Sync tests: 95-100% (some variation from BLE jitter)

           self.ble = ble_conn
           self.test_results = {}

       def send_command(self, command):
           """Send command with EOT, wait for response."""
           # Implementation

       def test_feature_name(self):
           """Test specific feature."""
           # Test implementation

   def run_all_tests(ble_conn):
       """Run complete test suite."""
       # Test execution
   ```

### Test Naming Conventions

- **File:** `feature_commands_test.py` or `feature_test.py`
- **Class:** `FeatureCommandsTester` or `FeatureTester`
- **Methods:** `test_specific_behavior()`
- **Runner:** `run_all_tests(ble_conn)`

### Documentation Requirements

Every test file must include:
