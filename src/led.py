Consolidated LED Controller
============================
Complete LED control system for BlueBuzzah v2.

This module consolidates all LED functionality into a single file:
- Base LED operations (flash, solid, off)
- Boot sequence patterns (BLE init, connection, ready)
- Therapy state patterns (running/breathing, paused, stopping)
- Battery warnings and critical alerts
